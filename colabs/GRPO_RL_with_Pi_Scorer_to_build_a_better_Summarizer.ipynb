What's the best way to split expenses?\\n\\nPOST: My boyfriend and I are discussing moving in together in the fall when his lease is up. We've been together for just over a year.\\n\\nWe both make a similar salary. He makes about $2K more than I do. We have been discussing how to share expenses and split the bills. We are both open to communication and discussion on this life change.\\n\\nExpect is a strong word here, but I would expect this would be a landlord-tenant style relationship in the sense that I would cover all household expenses related to home maintenance. Plumbing, electrical, roofing, appliances ... If anything breaks, then that's on me. With regards to bills we both contribute to (water, electricity, internet, etc), I'd expect to split those down the middle. With regards to the monthly payment, I'd also expect to split that down the middle. The reason for that is that it's a reasonable amount that's about equivalent to his current apartment rent. If we were to find a place to rent together, the expectation would be that we'd split a rent payment 50/50. I see the house as a shared space so I think it's reasonable that we share the expense of the house.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I will be building equity in the home and he will not. However, I did put down $60K of my own money when I purchased the house.\\n\\nTL;DR:\",\n          \"SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\\n\\nTITLE: I [M20] met a girl [F20] who i really like while backpacking europe and i dont know what to do.\\n\\nPOST: I met her initially in berlin, where I only got to spend a day with her. I instantly knew there was something between us, I didnt know what but we just clicked strait away. I would have stayed there longer just to be with her if I could have.\\n\\nI met with her again a few months later In london. We spent another 3 days together and I learned we have so much in common. Like a creepy amount in common. Almost all the same interests and hobbies. We had an amazing night out that ended with us sharing a bed and the next day we just spent time together talking.\\n\\n We've arranged to spend another 10 days together next week, just the 2 of us, and I've never been more excited for anything in my life. I havnt been able to stop thinking about her since we last seperated.\\n\\nWere both not the most experienced with relationships (mostly me) so I'm finding it hard to tell her how I feel.

I got really loose on the first date and may or may not have said that i'm not looking for anything serious. We went out on brunch and other stuff afterwards and sex just happened along the way. i have been going out on dates since then with other people but never went so far as sex. \\n\\nUntil very recently, we see each other on average once a month and sometimes we just hang out. I have never slept over at his place before last night (i am a light sleeper and the idea of sleepover stressed me out) although he stayed at mine 2 out of the last three times he came over. \\n\\nAnother thing is frequency, he came over \\\"prepared\\\" (brushed his teeth, packed suit for next day) this thursday after i booty texted him while drunk. Then he wanted to see me on friday, which i turned down and on saturday again - to which i responded and went to stay at his place because my heater is broken. \\n\\nWe never define what it is, fuck buddies or fwb. Now that sleepover seems more regular, i don't know if it's time to bring up the question. If so, how should i communicate this?

When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!</p>\n",

Right around that time, my gyno told me that I was due to have my IUD removed. Oh, okay! That's why I was a hormonal wreck! Bada bing, bada boom, I'll get it replaced and everything will be back to normal.</p>\n",

He scheduled the hysteroscopy and the aspiration of the mass for the next day. I was horrified and scared shitless. My boyfriend was very supportive, stayed up late rubbing my neck the night before the procedure, came with me to the doctor, took me out for more meals than I can count so that I didn't have to cook, etc.</p>\n",

Now I feel like there's something I'm always going to have to worry about. From what I understand based on talking to other women, this is a feeling that will eventually go away. But how do I explain myself to my partner and let him know that I'm aware that I'm being crazy right now without sounding like I'm trying to make excuses for being a completely and totally irrational asshole?</p>\n",

              "<p>POST: So recently I listened to the song Feel Again by OneRepublic. GREAT SONG. But it got me thinking: \"is my heart numb? Am I a lonely soul?\" All my friends tell me I am basically Ted Mosby (for those of u who are himym fans...) but I have seriously never been in a relationship and have always been friendzoned which is fine ya get used to it. But I have a couple girl friends (note the space) and theyre each awesome and I don't want to feel like I am choosing I just want to be head over heels for one. What do I do?! It is the summer before college and while I know it is a mistake to try to be in anything serious before college I feel like its one of those things where you just gotta take the leap. Can anyone help me here? I am sorry for making you read so much...</p>\n",

It just kind of pains me that I couldn't have her virginity like she had mine because it feels like I have a connection to her that she may not have with me. \\n\\nIdk, Her ex does tend to cause a lot of problems and this is one of them. She sometimes brings up sexual innuendo with is okay because it's fun to flirt, but sometimes it relates to her and her ex having sex (she doesnt say it intentionally) but it hurts me inside because I love the girl. \\n\\nYou may think i'm stupid for it or that we're just a cliche lovey-dovey couple of kids but we are madly in love...idk, we just don't act like other couples do (in a good way) I don't expect you to believe me, because a while ago, I wouldn't have either. \\n\\nI don't want to be criticized for having sex with her, because it's illegal, I understand that. But can anyone help calm my nerves? Is it normal for me to wish we had exchanged virginities? Or that I get sad when I hear about her ex? because I get mental images and they make me want to curl up and die.\\n\\nTL;DR:\",\n          \"SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\\n\\nTITLE: Need Advice: Child Support Rights [Son thinks father is \\\"family friend\\\", devout Christian mother won't let father see son]\\n\\nPOST: I was unsure which subreddit to put this under, and hope I receive some advice here.\\n\\nMy boyfriend has a son, six years old. He's been paying $120/mo in child support and has seen his son only 3-4 times. The insane Christian mother hates him, of course, and likes to see his pain. My boyfriend had plans to move 1500 miles away before the son was even conceived, and the mother despises him for running away. She therefore never lets him visit, not even a phone call. He played \\\"Santa\\\" last Christmas and dropped off a gift on the front porch for his son in which the next day he got a phone call from her saying to never come to their house again.\\n\\nShe is now demanding more chid support. He is a bartender and makes $2000/mo but sometimes can make more, so he is looking at having to pay $498-$900 per month for one child he never ever sees, and the son doesn't even know who his real father is. The mother won't let him see him anywhere at all, see him at school, share photos, (he has ONE picture of him from 4 years ago) , share grade reports, she won't even let him call to talk to his son on the phone for a minute. \\n\\nThey went to a therapist and the therapist said the longer the child waits and the more the child ages, the more psychologically damaged he will be subconsciously later in life. The mother doesn't care, she only cares for her selfish well-being and seeing my boyfriend suffer.\\n\\nI myself have no clue what to do. He has court on the 6th but can't afford an attorney, but there has to be another way.

After checking to see if he was breathing, my friend and I made sure no one else was in the car. Luckily, no one was. Four of us sat with him, talking to him as we waited for the ambulance to arrive. He was lying face down, but I could tell his ribs were destroyed, and his face was totally fucked too, his attempts at breathing through the blood that was drowning him are echoing in my head. He tried to lift his face, but worried that his neck was hurt in ways I couldn't tell and that moving his head could possibly hurt him more, I patted his hair and told him everything was going to be okay, we stayed with him until the paramedics arrived. \\n\\nWe were waiting outside, worried because the ambulance hadn't left yet, and then when we saw the coroner on sight I just lost it. \\n\\nI didn't know him, but I can't seem to get over it, I need some help. I'm working on contacting my campuses psychologist, but I know that just talking about it won't get his mangeled body and choking breaths out of my head. \\n\\nPlease, if you experienced a traumatic event, what helped you get through it.

She did not really give me back much but I figured she had a much higher status and was a much better person than I was so that was ok, I was the one who was supposed to be reaching. I dropped the L bomb, she didn't requite. We came back from spring break and she broke up with me because things felt different. I was under a lot of pressure and I was not able to be the totally fun, carefree person she had come to love so she ended it. Tt was really tough but I was ok with it in a way I still can't explain. Immediately (1 day) after we broke up she wanted to get back together, but not officially. She wanted an open or friends with benefits relationship. I tried it for two weeks and it was too much for me and so I ended it.</p>\n",

              "<p>POST: Hey reddit. i'm a guy, a senior in college, and recently started accepting the fact that I like other dudes. I've never been in a romantic relationship and I really like having close friends because they're the closest I can get to being in a romantic relationship (i'll explain more further down). Also, seeing as i'm gay, many societal and religious forces have discouraged me from pursuing a gay relationship/marriage. And I really don't feel comfortable being in one for that reason.</p>\n",
              "<p>This is a problem because it makes me very insecure about my friendships since these relationships are the \"epitome\" of whatever kind of intimacy I'll ever have with another human being. I feel like my friends don't put in as much effort as I do in the friendship because they have tangible romantic relationships or the IDEA of having one (getting married in the future, etc.) that they can fall back on--and I don't. Like this is it for me. It's ridiculously depressing. Is my way of thinking flawed?</p>\n",
              "<p>Additionally, I have this one really close friend that I have major feelings for. I'm unsure of his sexuality but we joke around about having sex/dating each other pretty regularly. He's my best bud and I confide in him every little thing about my life and so does he. It feels weird to say this but I love him. It feels awesome but also depressing because I know that some day he'll probably find a girl or something and I'll be left to rot. the idea is so much more salient now that graduation is right around the corner.</p>\n",
              "<p>He also always asks me to \"f*ck\" him jokingly but keeps repeating it on occasion. We've discussed girls before--he thinks i'm straight--but I'm still unsure of his sexuality. Does him asking me mean he has homosexual tendencies? Do straight guys do that with their friends? I'd really appreciate any help!</p>\n",
              "<p>i'm WAY too obsessed over this guy, I can't stop thinking about him and I miss him the second we end a conversation. How do i stop these feelings, if I should stop them at all?</p>\n",

              "<p>POST: So A few weeks ago I had a really bad injury that left me unable to walk for the next 3 months. I'm on painkillers and in physio and shit. That's just sort of a preface.</p>\n",
              "<p>So before this, my friends have been astounding. They've always been there when i've needed them and we all come from shitty home situations, so we're more family to eachother than our actual family. Anyways, yesterday was my 18th (yay) and my friends offered to come around 6. They ended up coming at 8:30 because they wanted to go to the LCBO and get booze so they can get piss-drunk at one of their houses (19/m) who has the house to himself for the night. Two of them left after a half an hour to go pick up from some guy and they never came back. 15 minutes later, 19/m's girlfriend, 17/f gets a call from him saying that everyone should leave and go to his house, and he'd come chill today instead bc he felt bad. I said nothing because I'm the sort of person who likes to keep the harmony, but it really hurt my feelings. From my perspective, I'm trapped on a fucking couch for 3 months straight in a shitty home situation with no one to keep me company and nothing to do, I cant walk, cant smoke, cant drink or do anything because of my meds, and they ditch on my 18th birthday, the big one, to go get drunk. Am I overreacting or are they being fucking assholes? If so, what do I do/say, if anything?</p>\n",
