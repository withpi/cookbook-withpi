        " 3. **Using real examples for training.** If you have 300+ (the more the better) high-quality labeled examples, you can train a classifier directly. This will yield the best performance for your use case, but may take time to obtain. Therefore, steps (1) and (2) are a great way to quickly deploy a first iteration of a system that can be used to collect high-quality inputs, which can then be labeled to build a high quality training set."
