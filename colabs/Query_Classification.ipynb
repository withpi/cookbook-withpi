        " 1. **Providing more inputs for input generation.** If you have 20-100 inputs, sharing more inputs as seed for data generation can be helpful.\n",
        " 2. **Using real input data for training.** If you have 100+ inputs, you can use those inputs as the inputs to teacher model, rather than using generated input. These models will better reflect the **input distribution**, or the data that the model will see during inference.\n",
        " 3. **Using real examples for training.** If you have 300+ (the more the better) high-quality labeled examples, you can train a classifier directly. This will yield the best performance for your use case, but may take time to obtain. Therefore, steps (1) and (2) are a great way to quickly deploy a first iteration of a system that can be used to collect high-quality inputs, which can then be labeled to build a high quality training set."
