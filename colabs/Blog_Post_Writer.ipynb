A condensed version of these blogs were scraped and loaded into Hugging Face for this colab at: [withpi/machinelearningmastery_com_blogs_condensed](https://huggingface.co/datasets/withpi/machinelearningmastery_com_blogs_condensed)\n",

        "2.   Then we will evaluate a prompted model against this contract\n",

              "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
              "<p>Deploying machine learning models is a critical step in bringing AI technologies to the real world. However, this process can be challenging as models must continue to perform well in changing environments. The following tips aim to guide practitioners in best practices for model deployment, covering optimization, containerization, deployment processes, monitoring, and security.</p>\n",
              "<h2>1. Optimize Your Models for Production</h2>\n",
              "<p>In production, machine learning models require optimization to meet latency demands and resource constraints. Several techniques can help:</p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Quantization</strong>: Reduces bits used to represent weights, creating smaller models with faster inference</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Pruning</strong>: Eliminates unnecessary weights for a streamlined model</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Knowledge distillation</strong>: Transfers knowledge from larger to smaller models</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<p>Tools like TensorFlow Lite and ONNX can optimize models during conversion, making them ready for inference in various settings, including embedded and mobile environments.</p>\n",
              "<h2>2. Containerize Your Application</h2>\n",
              "<p>Containerization packages your model and its dependencies into a single deployable artifact that can run in virtually any environment. This approach provides:</p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li>Portability across different systems</li>\n",
              "<li>Independence from host system configurations</li>\n",
              "<li>Consistent runtime environments</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<p>Docker is a popular containerization tool that creates encapsulated, portable software packages. Kubernetes can effectively manage container lifecycles. Mastering containerization is essential for machine learning engineers looking to widen their audience and manage projects in production.</p>\n",
              "<h2>3. Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</h2>\n",
              "<p>CI/CD improves the reliability of model deployment by automating testing, deployment, and updates. This approach makes exception handling in system testing and updates seamless.</p>\n",
              "<p>Tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions can carry out CI/CD processes:\n",
              "- <strong>Jenkins</strong>: An open-source automation server for building, testing, and deploying code\n",
              "- <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>: Provides flexible CI/CD workflows integrated with GitHub repositories</p>\n",
              "<p>Both tools help automate the entire machine learning model deployment lifecycle through configuration files.</p>\n",
              "<h2>4. Monitor Model Performance in Production</h2>\n",
              "<p>Once deployed, models need careful observation to ensure continued value. Effective monitoring includes:</p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li>Tracking model accuracy, response time, and resource usage</li>\n",
              "<li>Implementing solid logging strategies</li>\n",
              "<li>Setting up automated alerting systems for performance deviations</li>\n",
              "<li>Creating centralized dashboards for holistic views of all deployed models</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<p>Proactive monitoring allows for immediate investigation of issues like model drift, minimizing potential disruptions.</p>\n",
              "<h2>5. Ensure Model Security and Compliance</h2>\n",
              "<p>Security is crucial but often overlooked in model deployment. Simple steps with significant impact include:</p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li>Safeguarding models at rest and during transit</li>\n",
              "<li>Limiting access to models and their inputs</li>\n",
              "<li>Understanding your model's internal structure for better defense</li>\n",
              "<li>Ensuring regulatory compliance</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<p>These measures help protect against breaches and maintain responsible AI practices.</p>\n",
              "<h2>Summary</h2>\n",
              "<p>Deploying machine learning models effectively involves optimization for better performance, containerization for portability, CI/CD for reliable updates, monitoring for continued accuracy, and security measures for protection and compliance.</p>\n",

              "<h3>1. Text Encoder</h3>\n",
              "<p>Transforms text prompts into embeddings to guide the denoising process. Initially used frozen CLIP ViT-L/14, but improved variants switched to OpenCLIP with larger parameter sizes (354M+ vs 63M).</p>\n",
              "<h3>2. U-Net</h3>\n",
              "<p>Transforms noisy images into cleaner forms by receiving noisy latents and textual embeddings. It predicts noise in the input and subtracts it to generate denoised latents. Includes attention layers that focus on specific parts based on textual information.</p>\n",
              "<h3>3. Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)</h3>\n",

              "<p><strong>Step 1: Preparing the Image</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>To begin, upload the image you want to inpaint or outpaint to the Stable Diffusion Web UI interface. You can either upload a new image or select an existing one from your local machine.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Step 2: Configuring Inpainting Settings</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>For inpainting, navigate to the \"Inpainting\" tab and configure the following settings:</p>\n",

              "<li><strong>Model</strong>: Choose the Stable Diffusion model you want to use for inpainting. The default model is \" Stable Diffusion v1.4\".</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Steps</strong>: Adjust the number of steps for the inpainting process. A higher number of steps can result in more detailed and accurate inpainting.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Sampling</strong>: Select the sampling strategy for the inpainting process. The default sampling strategy is \"Denoising Diffusion\".</li>\n",
              "</ol>\n",
              "<p><strong>Step 3: Running the Inpainting Process</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>Click the \"Inpaint\" button to start the inpainting process. The Stable Diffusion model will generate a new image with the inpainted region.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Step 4: Configuring Outpainting Settings</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>For outpainting, navigate to the \"Outpainting\" tab and configure the following settings:</p>\n",
              "<ol>\n",
              "<li><strong>Boundary</strong>: Select the boundary of the image you want to outpaint. You can use the built-in boundary tools or upload a custom boundary.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Model</strong>: Choose the Stable Diffusion model you want to use for outpainting. The default model is \" Stable Diffusion v1.4\".</li>\n",

Building on this foundation, we now address another crucial aspect of data preprocessing—handling missing values. Missing data can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of models if not appropriately managed. This post explores various imputation strategies to address missing data and embed them into our pipeline. This approach allows us to further refine our predictive accuracy by incorporating previously excluded features, thus making the most of our rich dataset.</p>\n",

Our previous exploration of the Ames Housing dataset provided foundational insights into <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/classifying_variables/\">using the data dictionary</a> to tackle missing data. We demonstrated manual imputation strategies tailored to different data types, considering domain knowledge and data dictionary details. For example, categorical variables missing in the dataset often indicate an absence of the feature (e.g., a missing 'PoolQC' might mean no pool exists), guiding our imputation to fill these with \"None\" to preserve the dataset's integrity. Meanwhile, numerical features were handled differently, employing techniques like mean imputation.</p>\n",
              "<p>Now, by automating these processes with scikit-learn's <code>SimpleImputer</code>, we enhance reproducibility and efficiency.

The classical algorithm to train neural networks is [stochastic gradient descent](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gradient-descent-for-machine-learning/). It has been well established that you can achieve increased performance and faster training on some problems by using a [learning rate](https://machinelearningmastery.com/learning-rate-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/) that changes during training.\\n\\nIn this post, you will discover what is learning rate schedule and how you can use different learning rate schedules for your neural network models in PyTorch.\\n\\nAfter reading this post, you will know:\\n\\n* The role of learning rate schedule in model training\\n* How to use learning rate schedule in PyTorch training loop\\n* How to set up your own learning rate schedule\\n\\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cheung-yin-A_lVW8yIQM0-unsplash.jpg)\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThis post is divided into three parts:\\n\\n* Learning Rate Schedule for Training Models\\n* Applying Learning Rate Schedule in PyTorch Training\\n* Custom Learning Rate Schedules\\n\\n## Learning Rate Schedule for Training Models\\n\\nGradient descent is an algorithm of numerical optimization. What it does is to update parameters using the formula:\\n\\nw:=w\\u2013\\u03b1dydw\\n\\nIn this formula, w is the parameter, e.g., the weight in a neural network, and y is the objective, e.g., the loss function. What it does is to move w to the direction that you can minimize y. The direction is provided by the differentiation, dydw, but how much you should move w is controlled by the **learning rate** \\u03b1.\\n\\nAn easy start is to use a constant learning rate in gradient descent algorithm. But you can do better with a **learning rate schedule**. A schedule makes learning rate adaptive to the gradient descent optimization procedure, so you can increase performance and reduce training time.\\n\\nIn neural network training, data is fed into the network in batches, with many batches in one epoch. Each batch triggers one training step, which updates the parameters once. However, usually the learning rate schedule is updated once for each [training epoch](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-batch-and-an-epoch/) only.\\n\\nThere are multiple ways of making learning rate adaptive:\\n- At the beginning of training, you may prefer a larger learning rate to improve the network coarsely and speed up progress\\n- In complex neural networks, you may prefer to gradually increase the learning rate at the beginning to help the network explore different dimensions\\n- At the end of training, you always want a smaller learning rate to avoid overshooting when you're close to optimal performance\\n\\nThe simplest and perhaps most used adaptation is to reduce the learning rate over time. This allows for large changes early in training when larger learning rates are used, and smaller updates later when a smaller rate is needed for fine-tuning.\\n\\n## Applying Learning Rate Schedules in PyTorch Training\\n\\nIn PyTorch, a model is updated by an optimizer and learning rate is a parameter of the optimizer. Learning rate schedule is an algorithm to update the learning rate in an optimizer.\\n\\nBelow is an example of creating a learning rate schedule:\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.optim as optim\\nimport torch.optim.lr_scheduler as lr_scheduler\\nscheduler = lr_scheduler.LinearLR(optimizer, start_factor=1.0, end_factor=0.3, total_iters=10)\\n```\\n\\nThere are many learning rate schedulers provided by PyTorch in the `torch.optim.lr_scheduler` submodule. All schedulers need the optimizer to update as the first argument, plus additional arguments depending on the scheduler type.\\n\\nLet's start with an example model for the [ionosphere binary classification problem](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere). This is a small dataset that you can [download from the UCI Machine Learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/ionosphere/ionosphere.data).\\n\\nA small neural network model is constructed with a single hidden layer with 34 neurons, using the ReLU activation function. The output layer has a single neuron and uses the sigmoid activation function to output probability-like values.\\n\\nPlain stochastic gradient descent algorithm is used, with a fixed learning rate 0.1. The model is trained for 50 epochs. The state parameters of an optimizer can be found in `optimizer.param_groups`; the learning rate is a floating point value at `optimizer.param_groups[0][\\\"lr\\\"]`.\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.nn as nn\\nimport torch.optim as optim\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\n\\n# load dataset, split into input (X) and output (y) variables\\ndataframe = pd.read_csv(\\\"ionosphere.csv\\\", header=None)\\ndataset = dataframe.values\\nX = dataset[:,0:34].astype(float)\\ny = dataset[:,34]\\n\\n# encode class values as integers\\nencoder = LabelEncoder()\\nencoder.fit(y)\\ny = encoder.transform(y)\\n\\n# convert into PyTorch tensors\\nX = torch.tensor(X, dtype=torch.float32)\\ny = torch.tensor(y, dtype=torch.float32).reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n# train-test split for evaluation of the model\\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.7, shuffle=True)\\n\\n# create model\\nmodel = nn.Sequential(\\n    nn.Linear(34, 34),\\n    nn.ReLU(),\\n    nn.Linear(34, 1),\\n    nn.Sigmoid()\\n)\\n\\n# Train the model\\nn_epochs = 50\\nbatch_size = 24\\nbatch_start = torch.arange(0, len(X_train), batch_size)\\nlr = 0.1\\nloss_fn = nn.BCELoss()\\noptimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr)\\nmodel.train()\\nfor epoch in range(n_epochs):\\n    for start in batch_start:\\n        X_batch = X_train[start:start+batch_size]\\n        y_batch = y_train[start:start+batch_size]\\n        y_pred = model(X_batch)\\n        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch)\\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\\n        loss.backward()\\n        optimizer.step()\\n    print(\\\"Epoch %d: SGD lr=%.4f\\\" % (epoch, optimizer.param_groups[0][\\\"lr\\\"]))\\n\\n# evaluate accuracy after training\\nmodel.eval()\\ny_pred = model(X_test)\\nacc = (y_pred.round() == y_test).float().mean()\\nacc = float(acc)\\nprint(\\\"Model accuracy: %.2f%%\\\" % (acc*100))\\n```\\n\\nRunning this model produces:\\n```\\nEpoch 0: SGD lr=0.1000\\nEpoch 1: SGD lr=0.1000\\n...\\nEpoch 49: SGD lr=0.1000\\nModel accuracy: 86.79%\\n```\\n\\nTo introduce a learning rate scheduler, you need to run its `step()` function in the training loop:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.nn as nn\\nimport torch.optim as optim\\nimport torch.optim.lr_scheduler as lr_scheduler\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\n\\n# [data loading and model setup code same as before]\\n\\n# Train the model\\nn_epochs = 50\\nbatch_size = 24\\nbatch_start = torch.arange(0, len(X_train), batch_size)\\nlr = 0.1\\nloss_fn = nn.BCELoss()\\noptimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr)\\nscheduler = lr_scheduler.LinearLR(optimizer, start_factor=1.0, end_factor=0.5, total_iters=30)\\nmodel.train()\\nfor epoch in range(n_epochs):\\n    for start in batch_start:\\n        X_batch = X_train[start:start+batch_size]\\n        y_batch = y_train[start:start+batch_size]\\n        y_pred = model(X_batch)\\n        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch)\\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\\n        loss.backward()\\n        optimizer.step()\\n    before_lr = optimizer.param_groups[0][\\\"lr\\\"]\\n    scheduler.step()\\n    after_lr = optimizer.param_groups[0][\\\"lr\\\"]\\n    print(\\\"Epoch %d: SGD lr %.4f -> %.4f\\\" % (epoch, before_lr, after_lr))\\n```\\n\\nThis prints:\\n```\\nEpoch 0: SGD lr 0.1000 -> 0.0983\\nEpoch 1: SGD lr 0.0983 -> 0.0967\\n...\\nEpoch 29: SGD lr 0.0517 -> 0.0500\\nEpoch 30: SGD lr 0.0500 -> 0.0500\\n...\\nEpoch 49: SGD lr 0.0500 -> 0.0500\\nModel accuracy: 88.68%\\n```\\n\\nIn the above, `LinearLR()` is used with `start_factor=1.0`, `end_factor=0.5`, and `total_iters=30`, making the multiplicative factor decrease from 1.0 to 0.5 in 30 equal steps. After 30 steps, the factor stays at 0.5. This factor is multiplied by the original learning rate, so it decreases from 0.1\\u00d71.0=0.1 to 0.1\\u00d70.5=0.05.\\n\\nYou can also use `ExponentialLR()`:\\n```python\\nscheduler = lr_scheduler.ExponentialLR(optimizer, gamma=0.99)\\n```\\n\\nThis would update the learning rate by multiplying with a constant factor `gamma` in each scheduler update.\\n\\n## Custom Learning Rate Schedules\\n\\nThere is no general rule that a particular learning rate schedule works best. Sometimes, you may want a special learning rate schedule that PyTorch doesn't provide. A custom learning rate schedule can be defined using a custom function.\\n\\nFor example, if you want a learning rate that follows:\\nlrn=lr0/(1+\\u03b1n)\\n\\non epoch n, where lr0 is the initial learning rate and \\u03b1 is a constant, you can implement:\\n\\n```python\\ndef lr_lambda(epoch):\\n    # LR to be 0.1 * (1/1+0.01*epoch)\\n    base_lr = 0.1\\n    factor = 0.01\\n    return base_lr/(1+factor*epoch)\\n\\nscheduler = lr_scheduler.LambdaLR(optimizer, lr_lambda)\\n```\\n\\nNote that although the function provided to `LambdaLR()` assumes an argument `epoch`, it's not tied to the epoch in the training loop but simply counts how many times you invoked `scheduler.step()`.\\n\\n## Tips for Using Learning Rate Schedules\\n\\n* **Increase the initial learning rate**. Because the learning rate will likely decrease, start with a larger value. A larger learning rate will result in larger changes to the weights at the beginning, allowing you to benefit from fine-tuning later.\\n* **Use a large momentum**. Many optimizers can consider momentum. Using a larger momentum value will help the optimization algorithm continue to make updates in the right direction when your learning rate shrinks to small values.\\n* **Experiment with different schedules**. Try different schedules with different configuration options to see what works best on your problem. Try schedules that change exponentially and even schedules that respond to the accuracy of your model on the training or test datasets.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nIn this post, you discovered learning rate schedules for training neural network models.\\n\\nYou learned:\\n* How learning rate affects your model training\\n* How to set up learning rate schedule in PyTorch\\n* How to create a custom learning rate schedule\",\n          \"# Activation Functions in PyTorch\\n\\nBy [Muhammad Asad Iqbal Khan](https://machinelearningmastery.com/author/mohasad-iqbal/ \\\"Posts by Muhammad Asad Iqbal Khan\\\") on May 3, 2023 in [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://machinelearningmastery.com/category/deep-learning-with-pytorch/ \\\"View all items in Deep Learning with PyTorch\\\")\\n\\nAs neural networks become increasingly popular in the field of machine learning, it is important to understand the role that activation functions play in their implementation. In this article, you'll explore the concept of activation functions that are applied to the output of each neuron in a neural network to introduce non-linearity into the model. Without activation functions, neural networks would simply be a series of linear transformations, which would limit their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in data.\\n\\nPyTorch offers a variety of activation functions, each with its own unique properties and use cases. Some common activation functions in PyTorch include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. Choosing the right activation function for a particular problem can be an important consideration for achieving optimal performance in a neural network. You will see how to train a neural network in PyTorch with different activation functions and analyze their performance.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn:\\n\\n* About various activation functions that are used in neural network architectures.\\n* How activation functions can be implemented in PyTorch.\\n* How activation functions actually compare with each other in a real problem.\\n\\nLet's get started.\\n\\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/torch-1.jpg)\\n\\nActivation Functions in PyTorch  \\nImage generated by Adrian Tam using stable diffusion. Some rights reserved.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThis tutorial is divided into four parts; they are:\\n\\n* Logistic activation function\\n* Tanh activation function\\n* ReLU activation function\\n* Exploring activation functions in a neural network\\n\\n## Logistic Activation Function\\n\\nYou'll start with the logistic function which is a commonly used activation function in neural networks and also known as the sigmoid function. It takes any input and maps it to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability. This makes it particularly useful for binary classification tasks, where the network needs to predict the probability of an input belonging to one of two classes.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of the logistic function is that it is differentiable, which means that it can be used in backpropagation algorithms to train the neural network. Additionally, it has a smooth gradient, which can help avoid issues such as exploding gradients. However, it can also introduce vanishing gradients during training.\\n\\nNow, let's apply logistic function on a tensor using PyTorch and draw it to see how it looks like.\\n\\n```python\\n# importing the libraries\\nimport torch\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n# create a PyTorch tensor\\nx = torch.linspace(-10, 10, 100)\\n# apply the logistic activation function to the tensor\\ny = torch.sigmoid(x)\\n# plot the results with a custom color\\nplt.plot(x.numpy(), y.numpy(), color='purple')\\nplt.xlabel('Input')\\nplt.ylabel('Output')\\nplt.title('Logistic Activation Function')\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/torch-activation-1.png)\\n\\nIn the example above, you have used the `torch.sigmoid()` function from the Pytorch library to apply the logistic activation function to a tensor `x`. You have used the matplotlib library to create the plot with a custom color.\\n\\n## Tanh Activation Function\\n\\nNext, you will investigate the tanh activation function which outputs values between \\u22121 and 1, with a mean output of 0. This can help ensure that the output of a neural network layer remains centered around 0, making it useful for normalization purposes. Tanh is a smooth and continuous activation function, which makes it easier to optimize during the process of gradient descent.\\n\\nLike the logistic activation function, the tanh function can be susceptible to the vanishing gradient problem, especially for deep neural networks with many layers. This is because the slope of the function becomes very small for large or small input values, making it difficult for gradients to propagate through the network.\\n\\nAlso, due to the use of exponential functions, tanh can be computationally expensive, especially for large tensors or when used in deep neural networks with many layers.\\n\\nHere is how to apply tanh on a tensor and visualize it.\\n\\n```python\\n# apply the tanh activation function to the tensor\\ny = torch.tanh(x)\\n# plot the results with a custom color\\nplt.plot(x.numpy(), y.numpy(), color='blue')\\nplt.xlabel('Input')\\nplt.ylabel('Output')\\nplt.title('Tanh Activation Function')\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/torch-activation-2.png)\\n\\n## ReLU Activation Function\\n\\nReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is another commonly used activation function in neural networks. Unlike the sigmoid and tanh functions, ReLU is a non-saturating function, which means that it does not become flat at the extremes of the input range. Instead, ReLU simply outputs the input value if it is positive, or 0 if it is negative.\\n\\nThis simple, piecewise linear function has several advantages over sigmoid and tanh activation functions. First, it is computationally more efficient, making it well-suited for large-scale neural networks. Second, ReLU has been shown to be less susceptible to the vanishing gradient problem, as it does not have a flattened slope. Plus, ReLU can help sparsify the activation of neurons in a network, which can lead to better generalization.\\n\\nHere's an example of how to apply the ReLU activation function to a PyTorch tensor `x` and plot the results.\\n\\n```python\\n# apply the ReLU activation function to the tensor\\ny = torch.relu(x)\\n# plot the results with a custom color\\nplt.plot(x.numpy(), y.numpy(), color='green')\\nplt.xlabel('Input')\\nplt.ylabel('Output')\\nplt.title('ReLU Activation Function')\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/torch-activation-3.png)\\n\\nBelow is the complete code to print all the activation functions discussed above.\\n\\n```python\\n# importing the libraries\\nimport torch\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n# create a PyTorch tensor\\nx = torch.linspace(-10, 10, 100)\\n# apply the logistic activation function to the tensor and plot\\ny = torch.sigmoid(x)\\nplt.plot(x.numpy(), y.numpy(), color='purple')\\nplt.xlabel('Input')\\nplt.ylabel('Output')\\nplt.title('Logistic Activation Function')\\nplt.show()\\n# apply the tanh activation function to the tensor and plot\\ny = torch.tanh(x)\\nplt.plot(x.numpy(), y.numpy(), color='blue')\\nplt.xlabel('Input')\\nplt.ylabel('Output')\\nplt.title('Tanh Activation Function')\\nplt.show()\\n# apply the ReLU activation function to the tensor and plot\\ny = torch.relu(x)\\nplt.plot(x.numpy(), y.numpy(), color='green')\\nplt.xlabel('Input')\\nplt.ylabel('Output')\\nplt.title('ReLU Activation Function')\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Exploring Activation Functions in a Neural Network\\n\\nActivation functions play a vital role in the training of deep learning models, as they introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns.\\n\\nLet's take the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 70000 grayscale images in 28\\u00d728 pixels of handwritten digits. You'll create a simple feedforward neural network to classify these digits, and experiment with different activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and Leaky ReLU.\\n\\n```python\\nimport torchvision.datasets as datasets\\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\\n# Load the MNIST dataset\\ntransform = transforms.ToTensor()\\ntrain_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='data/', train=True, transform=transform, download=True)\\ntest_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='data/', train=False, transform=transform, download=True)\\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(dataset=train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)\\ntest_loader = DataLoader(dataset=test_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=False)\\n```\\n\\nLet's create a `NeuralNetwork` class that inherits from `nn.Module`. This class has three linear layers and an activation function as an input parameter. The forward method defines the forward pass of the network, applying the activation function after each linear layer except the last one.\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.nn as nn\\nimport torch.optim as optim\\nclass NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):\\n    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes, activation_function):\\n        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()\\n        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\\n        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)\\n        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)\\n        self.activation_function = activation_function\\n    def forward(self, x):\\n        x = self.activation_function(self.layer1(x))\\n        x = self.activation_function(self.layer2(x))\\n        x = self.layer3(x)\\n        return x\\n```\\n\\nYou've added an `activation_function` parameter to the `NeuralNetwork` class, which allows you to plug in any activation function you'd like to experiment with.\\n\\n## Training and Testing the Model with Different Activation Functions\\n\\nLet's create functions to help the training. The `train()` function trains the network for one epoch. It iterates through the training data loader, computes the loss, and performs backpropagation and optimization. The `test()` function evaluates the network on the test dataset, computing the test loss and accuracy.\\n\\n```python\\ndef train(network, data_loader, criterion, optimizer, device):\\n    network.train()\\n    running_loss = 0.0\\n    for data, target in data_loader:\\n        data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\\n        data = data.view(data.shape[0], -1)\\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\\n        output = network(data)\\n        loss = criterion(output, target)\\n        loss.backward()\\n        optimizer.step()\\n        running_loss += loss.item() * data.size(0)\\n    return running_loss / len(data_loader.dataset)\\n\\ndef test(network, data_loader, criterion, device):\\n    network.eval()\\n    correct = 0\\n    total = 0\\n    test_loss = 0.0\\n    with torch.no_grad():\\n        for data, target in data_loader:\\n            data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\\n            data = data.view(data.shape[0], -1)\\n            output = network(data)\\n            loss = criterion(output, target)\\n            test_loss += loss.item() * data.size(0)\\n            _, predicted = torch.max(output.data, 1)\\n            total += target.size(0)\\n            correct += (predicted == target).sum().item()\\n    return test_loss / len(data_loader.dataset), 100 * correct / total\\n```\\n\\nTo compare them, let's create a dictionary of activation functions and iterate over them. For each activation function, you instantiate the `NeuralNetwork` class, define the criterion (`CrossEntropyLoss`), and set up the optimizer (`Adam`). Then, train the model for a specified number of epochs, calling the `train()` and `test()` functions in each epoch to evaluate the model's performance. You store the training loss, testing loss, and testing accuracy for each epoch in the results dictionary.\\n\\n```python\\ndevice = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\\ninput_size = 784\\nhidden_size = 128\\nnum_classes = 10\\nnum_epochs = 10\\nlearning_rate = 0.001\\n\\nactivation_functions = {\\n    'ReLU': nn.ReLU(),\\n    'Sigmoid': nn.Sigmoid(),\\n    'Tanh': nn.Tanh(),\\n    'LeakyReLU': nn.LeakyReLU()\\n}\\n\\nresults = {}\\n\\n# Train and test the model with different activation functions\\nfor name, activation_function in activation_functions.items():\\n    print(f\\\"Training with {name} activation function...\\\")\\n    \\n    model = NeuralNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes, activation_function).to(device)\\n    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\\n    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)\\n    \\n    train_loss_history = []\\n    test_loss_history = []\\n    test_accuracy_history = []\\n    \\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\\n        train_loss = train(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, device)\\n        test_loss, test_accuracy = test(model, test_loader, criterion, device)\\n        \\n        train_loss_history.append(train_loss)\\n        test_loss_history.append(test_loss)\\n        test_accuracy_history.append(test_accuracy)\\n        \\n        print(f\\\"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}, Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}%\\\")\\n    \\n    results[name] = {\\n        'train_loss_history': train_loss_history,\\n        'test_loss_history': test_loss_history,\\n        'test_accuracy_history': test_accuracy_history\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nYou may use Matplotlib to create plots comparing the performance of each activation function. You can create three separate plots to visualize the training loss, testing loss, and testing accuracy for each activation function over the epochs.\\n\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\n# Plot the training loss\\nplt.figure()\\nfor name, data in results.items():\\n    plt.plot(data['train_loss_history'], label=name)\\nplt.xlabel('Epoch')\\nplt.ylabel('Training Loss')\\nplt.legend()\\nplt.show()\\n\\n# Plot the testing loss\\nplt.figure()\\nfor name, data in results.items():\\n    plt.plot(data['test_loss_history'], label=name)\\nplt.xlabel('Epoch')\\nplt.ylabel('Testing Loss')\\nplt.legend()\\nplt.show()\\n\\n# Plot the testing accuracy\\nplt.figure()\\nfor name, data in results.items():\\n    plt.plot(data['test_accuracy_history'], label=name)\\nplt.xlabel('Epoch')\\nplt.ylabel('Testing Accuracy')\\nplt.legend()\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/torch-activation-6.png) \\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/torch-activation-5.png) \\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/torch-activation-4.png)\\n\\nThese plots provide a visual comparison of the performance of each activation function. By analyzing the results, you can determine which activation function works best for the specific task and dataset used in this example.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you have implemented some of the most popular activation functions in PyTorch. You also saw how to train a neural network in PyTorch with different activation functions, using the popular MNIST dataset. You explored ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and Leaky ReLU activation functions and analyzed their performance by plotting the training loss, testing loss, and testing accuracy.  \\nAs you can see, the choice of activation function plays an essential role in model performance.

This version does more than list and define the features; it categorizes them into **nominal**, **ordinal**, **discrete**, and **continuous** types, guiding our analysis approach.\\n\\n* **Nominal Variables** are categories without an order like 'Neighborhood'. They help in identifying segments for grouping analysis.\\n* **Ordinal Variables** have a clear order (e.g 'KitchenQual'). They allow for ranking and order-based analysis but don't imply equal spacing between categories.\\n* **Discrete Variables** are countable numbers, like 'Bedroom'. They are integral to analyses that sum or compare quantities.\\n* **Continuous Variables** measure on a continuous scale, like 'Lot Area'. They enable a wide range of statistical analyses that depend on granular detail.\\n\\nUnderstanding these variable types also guides the selection of appropriate visualization techniques. **Nominal and ordinal variables** are well-suited to bar charts, which can effectively highlight categorical differences and rankings. In contrast, **discrete and continuous variables** are best represented through histograms, scatter plots, and line charts, which illustrate distributions, relationships, and trends within the data.\\n\\n**Kick-start your project** with my book [The Beginner's Guide to Data Science](https://machinelearning.samcart.com/products/beginners-guide-data-science/). It provides **self-study tutorials** with **working code**.\\n\\n## Identifying Categorical and Numerical Variables\\n\\nBuilding on our understanding of the data dictionary, let's delve into how we can practically distinguish between categorical and numerical variables within the Ames dataset using Python's pandas library. This step is crucial for informing our subsequent data processing and analysis strategies.\\n\\n```python\\n# Load and obtain the data types from the Ames dataset\\nimport pandas as pd\\nAmes = pd.read_csv('Ames.csv')\\nprint(Ames.dtypes)\\nprint(Ames.dtypes.value_counts())\\n```\\n\\nExecuting the above code will yield the following output, categorizing each feature by its data type:\\n\\n```\\nPID                int64\\nGrLivArea          int64\\nSalePrice          int64\\nMSSubClass         int64\\nMSZoning          object\\n...\\nSaleCondition     object\\nGeoRefNo         float64\\nProp_Addr         object\\nLatitude         float64\\nLongitude        float64\\nLength: 85, dtype: object\\n\\nobject     44\\nint64      27\\nfloat64    14\\ndtype: int64\\n```\\n\\nThis output reveals that the dataset comprises `object` (44 variables), `int64` (27 variables), and `float64` (14 variables) data types. Here, `object` typically indicates nominal variables, which are categorical data without an inherent order. Meanwhile, `int64` and `float64` suggest numerical data, which could be either discrete (`int64` for countable numbers) or continuous (`float64` for measurable quantities on a continuous scale).\\n\\nNow we can leverage pandas' `select_dtypes()` method to explicitly separate numerical and categorical features within the Ames dataset.\\n\\n```python\\n# Build on the above block of code\\n# Separating numerical and categorical features\\nnumerical_features = Ames.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns\\ncategorical_features = Ames.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns\\n# Displaying the separated lists\\nprint(\\\"Numerical Features:\\\", numerical_features)\\nprint(\\\"Categorical Features:\\\", categorical_features)\\n```\\n\\nThe `numerical_features` captures variables stored as `int64` and `float64`, indicative of countable and measurable quantities, respectively. Conversely, the `categorical_features` comprises variables of type `object`, typically representing nominal or ordinal data without a quantitative value.\\n\\nNotably, some variables, like 'MSSubClass' despite being encoded numerically, actually serve as categorical data, underscoring the importance of referring back to our data dictionary for accurate classification. Similarly, features like 'MoSold' (Month Sold) and 'YrSold' (Year Sold) are numerical in nature, but they can often be treated as categorical variables, especially when there is no interest in performing mathematical operations on them. We can use the `astype()` method in pandas to convert these to categorical features.\\n\\n```python\\n# Building on the above 2 blocks of code\\nAmes['MSSubClass'] = Ames['MSSubClass'].astype('object')\\nAmes['YrSold'] = Ames['YrSold'].astype('object')\\nAmes['MoSold'] = Ames['MoSold'].astype('object')\\nprint(Ames.dtypes.value_counts())\\n```\\n\\nAfter performing this conversion, the count of columns with the `object` data type has increased to 47 (from the previous 44), while `int64` has dropped to 24 (from 27).\\n\\n```\\nobject     47\\nint64      24\\nfloat64    14\\ndtype: int64\\n```\\n\\nA careful assessment of the data dictionary, the nature of the dataset, and domain expertise can contribute to properly reclassifying data types.\\n\\n## Missing Data Imputation\\n\\nDealing with missing data is a challenge that every data scientist faces. Ignoring missing values or handling them inadequately can lead to skewed analysis and incorrect conclusions. The choice of imputation technique often depends on the nature of the data\\u2014categorical or numerical. In addition, information in the data dictionary will be useful (such as the case for Pool Quality) where a missing value (\\\"NA\\\") has a meaning, namely the absence of this feature for a particular property.\\n\\n**Data Imputation For Categorical Features with Missing Values**\\n\\nYou can identify categorical data types and rank them in the order in which they are most affected by missing data.\\n\\n```python\\n# Calculating the percentage of missing values for each column\\nmissing_data = Ames.isnull().sum()\\nmissing_percentage = (missing_data / len(Ames)) * 100\\ndata_type = Ames.dtypes\\n# Combining the counts and percentages into a DataFrame for better visualization\\nmissing_info = pd.DataFrame({'Missing Values': missing_data, 'Percentage': missing_percentage,\\n'Data Type':data_type})\\n# Sorting the DataFrame by the percentage of missing values in descending order\\nmissing_info = missing_info.sort_values(by='Percentage', ascending=False)\\n# Display columns with missing values of 'object' data type\\nprint(missing_info[(missing_info['Missing Values'] > 0) & (missing_info['Data Type'] == 'object')])\\n```\\n\\nThe data dictionary indicates that missing values for the entire list of categorical features above indicate the absence of that feature for a given property, except for \\\"Electrical\\\". With this insight, we can impute with the \\\"mode\\\" for the 1 missing data point for the electrical system and impute all others using `\\\"None\\\"` (with quotations to make it a Python string).\\n\\n```python\\n# Building on the above block of code\\n# Imputing Missing Categorical Data\\nmode_value = Ames['Electrical'].mode()[0]\\nAmes['Electrical'].fillna(mode_value, inplace=True)\\nmissing_categorical = missing_info[(missing_info['Missing Values'] > 0)\\n& (missing_info['Data Type'] == 'object')]\\nfor item in missing_categorical.index.tolist():\\n    Ames[item].fillna(\\\"None\\\", inplace=True)\\nprint(Ames[missing_categorical.index].isnull().sum())\\n```\\n\\n**Data Imputation For Numerical Features with Missing Values**\\n\\nWe can apply the same technique demonstrated above to identify numerical data types and rank them in the order in which they are most affected by missing data.\\n\\n```python\\n# Build on the above blocks of code\\n# Import Numpy\\nimport numpy as np\\n# Calculating the percentage of missing values for each column\\nmissing_data = Ames.isnull().sum()\\nmissing_percentage = (missing_data / len(Ames)) * 100\\ndata_type = Ames.dtypes\\n# Combining the counts and percentages into a DataFrame for better visualization\\nmissing_info = pd.DataFrame({'Missing Values': missing_data, 'Percentage': missing_percentage,\\n'Data Type':data_type})\\n# Sorting the DataFrame by the percentage of missing values in descending order\\nmissing_info = missing_info.sort_values(by='Percentage', ascending=False)\\n# Display columns with missing values of numeric data type\\nprint(missing_info[(missing_info['Missing Values'] > 0)\\n& (missing_info['Data Type'] == np.number)])\\n```\\n\\nThe above illustrates that there are fewer instances of missing numerical data versus missing categorical data. However, the data dictionary is not as useful for a straightforward imputation. Whether or not to impute missing data in data science largely depends on the goal of the analysis. Often, a data scientist may generate multiple imputations to account for the uncertainty in the imputation process. Common multiple imputation methods include (but are not limited to) mean, median, and regression imputation. As a baseline, we will illustrate how to employ mean imputation here, but may refer to other techniques depending on the task at hand.\\n\\n```python\\n# Build on the above blocks of code\\n# Initialize a DataFrame to store the concise information\\nconcise_info = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Feature', 'Missing Values After Imputation',\\n'Mean Value Used to Impute'])\\n# Identify and impute missing numerical values, and store the related concise information\\nmissing_numeric_df = missing_info[(missing_info['Missing Values'] > 0)\\n& (missing_info['Data Type'] == np.number)]\\nfor item in missing_numeric_df.index.tolist():\\n    mean_value = Ames[item].mean(skipna=True)\\n    Ames[item].fillna(mean_value, inplace=True)\\n    # Append the concise information to the concise_info DataFrame\\n    concise_info.loc[len(concise_info)] = pd.Series({\\n        'Feature': item,\\n        'Missing Values After Imputation': Ames[item].isnull().sum(),\\n        # This should be 0 as we are imputing all missing values\\n        'Mean Value Used to Impute': mean_value\\n    })\\n# Display the concise_info DataFrame\\nprint(concise_info)\\n```\\n\\nAt times, we may also opt to leave the missing value without any imputation to retain the authenticity of the original dataset and remove the observations that do not have complete and accurate data if required. Alternatively, you may also try to build a machine learning model to **guess** the missing value based on some other data in the same rows, which is the principle behind imputation by regression. As a final step of the above baseline imputation, let us cross-check if there are any missing values.\\n\\n```python\\n# Build on the above blocks of code\\nmissing_values_count = Ames.isnull().sum().sum()\\nprint(f'The DataFrame has a total of {missing_values_count} missing values.')\\n```\\n\\nYou should see:\\n```\\nThe DataFrame has a total of 0 missing values.\\n```\\n\\nCongratulations! We have successfully imputed every missing value in the Ames dataset using baseline operations. It's important to note that numerous other techniques exist for imputing missing data. As a data scientist, exploring various options and determining the most appropriate method for the given context is crucial to producing reliable and meaningful results.\\n\\n### Want to Get Started With Beginner's Guide to Data Science?\\n\\nTake my free email crash course now (with sample code).\\n\\nClick to sign-up and also get a free PDF Ebook version of the course.\\n\\nDownload Your FREE Mini-Course\\n\\n## Further Reading\\n\\n#### Resources\\n\\n* [Ames Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Padre-Media/dataset/main/Ames.csv)\\n* [Ames Data Dictionary (Expanded Version)](https://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt)\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we explored the Ames Housing dataset through the lens of data science techniques.

Understanding the year-to-year variations in housing prices during this period is crucial for policymakers, economists, and real estate professionals. In this blog post, we will explore the use of two non-parametric tests, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and Kruskal-Wallis, to analyze the statistical significance of housing price variations during the Great Recession.</p>\n",

              "<p>We will use a dataset of median housing prices in the United States from 2005 to 2010, sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). The dataset consists of 6 observations (one for each year) with a single variable, median housing price.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>ANOVA Test</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>The ANOVA test is a parametric test used to compare the means of three or more groups. However, since our dataset has only 6 observations, we will use the one-way ANOVA test to compare the means of the 6 groups (one for each year). The null hypothesis (H0) is that the means of the 6 groups are equal, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that at least one group has a different mean.</p>\n",

While both tests indicate no significant variations, the Kruskal-Wallis test is a more robust choice for this dataset due to its non-parametric nature. This analysis can be useful for policymakers, economists, and real estate professionals seeking to understand the impact of the Great Recession on the housing market.</p>\n",
